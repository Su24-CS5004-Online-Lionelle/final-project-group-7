# Final Project for CS 5004 - Crime: UK Police Data

This application is designed to help users search and manage crime data in Leicester, UK. The user interface includes a dropdown menu to select a crime category and a ‘Crime Search’ button to display crimes in the selected category. The ‘Crime Info’ pane shows detailed information about the crimes, while the ‘Crime Stats’ section provides statistical data, such as the total number of crimes and the number of crimes per street.

Users can interact with the map to view crime locations by clicking the ‘Show Crime Locations’ button, which places markers on the map. The ‘Add Crime’ button allows users to add crimes to a list, which is displayed in the ‘Crimes Added to List’ section. Finally, users can save the list of crimes to an XML file by clicking the ‘Save Crime’ button. The application also supports searching for all crimes and saving the entire dataset to a file.

This tool is useful for analyzing crime patterns and trends in Leicester, providing valuable insights for law enforcement and community safety initiatives.

Instructions:

When the program is run, the GUI displays a crime category dropdown and ‘Crime Search’ button at the top, a ‘Crime Info’ pane on the left, ‘Crime Stats’ and ‘Crimes Added to List’ sections on the right, a map of Leicester, UK in the center, and various interactive buttons at the bottom.

The first step is to select a category from the dropdown menu. Once a crime is selected and you click the ‘Crime Search’ button, all of the crimes from that category will be displayed in the ‘Crime Info’ section.

Next, you have the opportunity to select ‘Add Crime’, ‘Show Crime Locations’, or ‘Populate Crime Stats’. When the ‘Show Crime Locations’ button is clicked, the map will populate with markers showing the selected crimes’ locations. When the ‘Populate Crime Stats’ button is clicked, the ‘Crime Stats’ section will be populated with crime stats, including the total number of crimes and the number of crimes per street if greater than one. When the ‘Add Crime’ button is clicked, the ‘Crimes Added to List’ section will display the current category.

You can then click the ‘Save Crime’ button, and the current crimes added to the list will be saved to an XML file (crimes.xml). You have the ability to add multiple crimes to the list and save out the multiple crimes to the file. You can also search ‘all crimes’ to view all of the crimes and save all the crimes to the file.
