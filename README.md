# Final Project for CS 5004 - Crime: UK Police Data

(remove this and add your sections/elements)
This readme should contain the following information: 

* The group member's names and link to their personal githubs
* The application name and a brief description of the application
* Links to design documents and manuals
* Instructions on how to run the application

Ask yourself, if you started here in the readme, would you have what you need to work on this project and/or use the application?

When the program is run, the GUI displays a crime category dropdown and ‘Crime Search’ button at the top, a ‘Crime Info’ pane on the left, ‘Crime Stats’ and ‘Crimes Added to List’ sections on the right, a map of Leicester, UK in the center, and various interactive buttons at the bottom.

The first step is to select a category from the dropdown menu. Once a crime is selected and you click the ‘Crime Search’ button, all of the crimes from that category will be displayed in the ‘Crime Info’ section.

Next, you have the opportunity to select ‘Add Crime’, ‘Show Crime Locations’, or ‘Populate Crime Stats’. When the ‘Show Crime Locations’ button is clicked, the map will populate with markers showing the selected crimes’ locations. When the ‘Populate Crime Stats’ button is clicked, the ‘Crime Stats’ section will be populated with crime stats, including the total number of crimes and the number of crimes per street if greater than one. When the ‘Add Crime’ button is clicked, the ‘Crimes Added to List’ section will display the current category.

You can then click the ‘Save Crime’ button, and the current crimes added to the list will be saved to an XML file (crimes.xml). You have the ability to add multiple crimes to the list and save out the multiple crimes to the file. You can also search ‘all crimes’ to view all of the crimes and save all the crimes to the file.
